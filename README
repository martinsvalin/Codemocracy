This is the application to run CODEMOCRACY (http://codemocracy.org, http://codemocracy.se). 

Its purpose is to collect signups for the event (2010-09-04 -- 2010-09-05), market the event and showcase 
apps and services built during the event.

The app is built using Rails 3 beta 4. It is localized for Swedish and English. It uses Haml for view 
templates, unobtrusive jQuery for RESTful actions, uses authlogic for authentication and delivers mail 
via gmail.
